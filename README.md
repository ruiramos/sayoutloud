# sayoutloud

The idea is to have this running on a Raspberry Pi somehow connected to 
a bluetooth speaker and being able to type `/say <something> #with-sound-sample` 
in Slack and have it play it.

It's pretty much working using FreeSound.org for the samples and say.js/festival
for TTS on the Pi - although it doesn't sound all that great. Maybe one day switch
to some decent TTS API?
